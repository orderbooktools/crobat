## this is the init for the postgres module in crobat library ##
## this should:
# 1. load the modules used to run postgres writing in crobat
# 2. set up the database or at least check that the database is loaded
# 3. prepare anything else that crobat may need before connecting.
# 4. setup the db connection as well? or should it be in the main()

# import config
# import sqlconnection
# import recorder.py
